How to Play:
Use the spacebar to follow the rhythm of a song!
Wait until an orange rectangle reaches the orange box at the bottom then press the spacebar to hit it.
Go for accuracy and combo, which can be seen on the left side of the screen.
Combo multiplies your hits' score values, while accuracy increases them by a flat amount.
There are several types of hits possible:
300 - basically perfect
100 - a little off
50 - pretty bad
0 - miss, you lose your combo
Accuracy is determined by how many points you would score compared to perfect if combo is not calculated.
A play with all 300s is perfect.
